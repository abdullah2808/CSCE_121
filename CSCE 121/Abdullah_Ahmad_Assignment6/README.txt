For the drills I used random number generation for the filling of the files withnumbers and I just chose some numbers for the int file
I did 0 = C and 1 = F for drill 4
for Part 1 I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/conversion-whole-string-uppercase-lowercase-using-stl-c/
to convert to lowercase
for part 2 to convert from I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stringstream-c-decimal-hexadecimal-back/ which supplied parts of the code
and I used string stream 
for part 3 I used the character classifcation from the textbook 


Yo I wasn't sure if we were supposed to do exercise 8 because we didn't do 6 or 7 and i'm working last minute. If we are can I turn it in later. 

Thanks TA reading this :)
