For iterators I used the below link 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-c-stl/
For lists I used the below link
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/list-cpp-stl/
For Q5 it was mostly just reimplementating stuff I did in the previous questions but with slightly different syntax 
For advancing through a list

The merge function just adds the two baskets into one basket
The difference function adds cookies that are different between the two baskets into on
the intersect function adds cookies that are similar into one function
the copy function just creates a copy of the inputed thing
I added inline to every function to get it to work cause I only used 1 file.
All the tests I did are commented out in the cookie.cpp
I used geeksforgeeks.org a lot for resource help and same with stackoverflow
