2. I made some mistakes using the if statement to check the char variable and a lot of formatting mistakes with the cout statements and the cin statements. Also I forgot some spaces in my " "

3. This program wasn't too difficult for me, it was mostly just a lot of typing.

4. I initially was doing this program with a vector that removed values based on the user responses and instead of halfing and halfing over and over I used a questions like is your number even or odd and does it round up or round down and removed values using if statements with modulo, but I found that was a lot of work and code and I restarted after I had roughly 150 lines of code and no solution, after I switched to just asking questions that would half with a while loop.

5. Program was fairly simple, I setup an array and used a for loop to sum up the the grades and then did calculations to the totals then
and printed them. I also messed up the calculations on the quiz part of the grade because I forgot it was out of 10 instead of 100 like the other grades, but that was a fairly simple fix.

6. I had many difficulties mostly with the logic of the loops used throughout the program and the spaces. I learned how to use while loops very effictively. Printing the left side
was hard but after figuring that out the right side wasn't too bad, because you didn't have to account for blank spaces. After figuring out the formatting for single digits, double
digits were difficult too and I had to mess around with some of my code. I used If statements to check if the number was a double digit to print out a single or a double space after.
