Quadratic Equation:
Doing the complex roots was the difficult part, everything else was just a whole bunch of coding. Using return statements with
a switch statement was super useful and having the flow chart was also a big help for the if-statements.

Test Cases: 
A: 4 B: 1 C:3 Results: 
Roots are complex and different.
x1 = -0.125+0.856957i
x2 = -0.125-0.856957i
A: 4 B: 5 C:1 Results:
There are two roots: -0.25 and x2: -1
A: 0 B: 0 C:0 Results:
There are infinite roots.
A: 0 B: 0 C:1 Results:
There are no roots.
A: 0 B: 5 C:4 Results:
There is one root: -0.8

Q5. Lucky Number Guess
Using some information from https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types I wrote the cases for the lucky numbers. I used an adder function to sum the digits of a number together
which drastically reduced the size of my code and I used while statements to make sure the numbers were under 10. I used a while loop to make sure the month day and year were entered in the correct format with exceptions thrown if it didn't fit 
Test Cases:
6 17 2000 Lucky Number 7: no did not fit
11 29 1999 Lucky Number 5: Yes did fit
10 25 1998 Lucky number 8: Yes did fit
9 22 2000 Lucky Number 6: Yes did fit
9 29 1999 lucky number 3: Did not fit
4 10 2000 lucky number 7: does fit
9 11 2000 lucky number 4: did not fit
2 7 2001 lucky number 3: Did Fit
12 26 1999 lucky number 3: did fit
1 8 2000 lucky number 2: did not fit
60% fit the roles 40% did not
