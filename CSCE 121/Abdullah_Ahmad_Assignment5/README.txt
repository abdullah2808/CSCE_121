I utilized stroustrups textbook online and read through the chapter for help for some parts

Part 1: doesn't function properly becaues there is no putback to hold the tokens
Part 2: utilizes putback which keeps tokens in the buffer, I also had to utilize #include "std_lib_facilities.h" -- this helps to handle erros which I found on stroustrup's code online
I modified the functions to look like the functions in quizzes we took in class, the code outputs when ; is entered and cancels when q is entered.
