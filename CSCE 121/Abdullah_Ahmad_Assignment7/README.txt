Inheritance is when you have a derived class from a base class
A virtual function is a function that is redefined in the derived class
A pure virtual function has no definition and is defined in a derived class
Polymorphism is whenever a function is invoked by a object of a certain class 
Drill 5 has an abstract error

PART 3:

for Part 3 I utilized http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/getline/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strdup-strdndup-functions-c/
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strlen/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whats-difference-between-char-s-and-char-s-in-c/
https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chars/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/

for part4:
I had a friend who took the class last semester assist me with the code and I used various different testing methods.
I only tested a few things in main but if you want you can modify the code to test more things 
I pulled some code off ecampus and added to it to make it easier personally
I also used previous assignment code. I tested with stud.txt
